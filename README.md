DeploYii
========

Fetch, setup, automate and deploy your projects!<br>
...powered by PHP & the Yii Framework.

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/giovdk21/deployii/v/stable.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/giovdk21/deployii) [![License](https://poser.pugx.org/giovdk21/deployii/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/giovdk21/deployii)

(once ready) you'll be able to use DeploYii either as a simple task runner to automate your project setup and configuration
or as deployment solution to package and deploy your code.


Requirements
-------------

- PHP 5.4+
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Git (command line)


Getting started
-------------

1. get DeploYii: `composer create-project giovdk21/deployii deployii ~0.5`
2. go inside the deployii folder (`cd deployii/`)
3. run `./deployii` to check the available options
4. run `./deployii fetch example_basic` to try out the basic example
5. run `./deployii run ~/.deployii/workspace/example_basic_[...]/basicExample/` to run it again, without re-downloading it
6. run `./deployii run ~/.deployii/workspace/example_basic_[...]/basicExample/ clean` to run the clean target
7. run `./deployii init ~/.deployii/workspace/helloWorld/` to create a new build script
